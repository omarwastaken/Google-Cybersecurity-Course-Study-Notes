## Escalate with a Purpose

### Incident Escalation

Security incident escalation is the process of identifying and transferring potential security incidents to a more experienced department or team member. As a security analyst, recognizing and reporting potential issues is crucial. When you join a new organization, you’ll learn the specific processes and procedures for escalating incidents.

### Notification of Breaches

Many countries have breach notification laws, which require companies and government entities to notify individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII). PII includes personal identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers), medical records, addresses, and other sensitive customer information. As an entry-level security analyst, staying aware of various security laws is essential, especially since they are regularly updated.

### Low-level Security Issues

Low-level security issues are security risks that do not result in the exposure of PII. Examples include:

- An employee having one failed login attempt on their account.
- An employee downloading unapproved software onto their work laptop.

These issues are not significant security challenges but must be investigated further in case they need to be escalated. For instance, multiple failed login attempts within a short period could indicate a malicious actor trying to compromise an account. Downloading unapproved software might introduce malware, which can harm devices or networks, leading to financial loss and reputation damage. While low-level security issues are not considered significant threats, they should be investigated to ensure minimal impact on the organization.

### The Escalation Process

Every company has different protocols and procedures, including unique escalation policies. These policies detail:

- Who should be notified when a security alert is received.
- Who should be contacted if the first responder is not available.
- How someone should specifically escalate an incident, whether via the IT desk, an incident management tool, or direct communication between security team members.

### Key Takeaways

Incident escalation is essential for protecting an organization’s data. A security analyst should be aware of the escalation protocols in place at their organization. Both small and large security issues should be escalated to the appropriate team or team member.

Understanding the importance of incident escalation and adhering to established protocols is vital for maintaining an organization’s security posture.

## Escalate with a Purpose

You previously learned about security incident escalation and the skills needed to help you escalate incidents. In this reading, you’ll learn the importance of escalating security issues and the potential impact of failing to escalate an issue.

### Incident Escalation

Security incident escalation is the process of identifying a potential security incident. During this process, potential incidents are transferred to a more experienced department or team member. As a security analyst, you’ll be expected to recognize potential issues, such as when an employee excessively enters the wrong credentials to their account, and report it to the appropriate person. When you join a new organization, you’ll learn about the specific processes and procedures for escalating incidents.

### Notification of Breaches

Many countries have breach notification laws, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the laws applicable in the area your company is operating in. Breach notification laws require companies and government entities to notify individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information (PII). PII includes personal identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, etc.), medical records, addresses, and other sensitive customer information. As an entry-level security analyst, you’ll need to be aware of various security laws, especially because they are regularly updated.

### Low-Level Security Issues

## Low-level security issues are security risks that do not result in the exposure of PII. These issues can include the following and other risks:

- An employee having one failed login attempt on their account
- An employee downloading unapproved software onto their work laptop

These issues are not significant security challenges, but they must be investigated further in case they need to be escalated. An employee typing in a password two to three times might not be of concern. But if that employee types in a password 15 times within 30 minutes, there might be an issue that needs to be escalated. What if the multiple failed login attempts were a malicious actor attempting to compromise an employee’s account? What if an employee downloads an internet game or software on their work laptop that is infected with malware? You previously learned that malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. If malware is downloaded onto an organization’s network, it can lead to financial loss and even loss of reputation with the organization’s customers. While low-level security issues are not considered significant security threats, they should still be investigated to ensure they result in minimal impact to the organization.

### The Escalation Process

Every company has different protocols and procedures, including unique escalation policies. These policies detail who should be notified when a security alert is received and who should be contacted if the first responder is not available. The policy will also determine how someone should specifically escalate an incident, whether it’s via the IT desk, an incident management tool, or direct communication between security team members.

### Key Takeaways

Incident escalation is essential for protecting an organization’s data. Every organization might have a different way of escalating security incidents. A security analyst should be aware of the escalation protocols that are in place at their organization. Both small and large security issues should be escalated to the appropriate team or team member.

## Recognize Roles and Responsibilities During Escalation

### Data Owners

A data owner is the person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information. Data owners have administrative control over specific information hardware or software and are accountable for the classification, protection, access, and use of company data.

**Example:** If an employee gains unauthorized access to software they do not need for work, this event would be escalated to the data owner of that software.

### Data Controllers

Data controllers determine the procedure and purpose for processing data. This role focuses on collecting the personal information of customers. The data controller determines how that data is used and ensures it is processed in accordance with relevant security and privacy regulations.

**Example:** If sensitive customer information is at risk, this event would be escalated to data controllers.

### Data Processors

Data processors report directly to the data controller and are responsible for processing the data on behalf of the data controller. The data processor is typically a vendor and is often tasked with installing security measures to help protect the data.

**Example:** Data processing issues are typically escalated to the individual who oversees the third-party organization responsible for data processing.

### Data Custodians

Data custodians assign and remove access to software or hardware. They are responsible for implementing security controls, granting and revoking access, creating policies, advising on potential threats, and monitoring the data.

**Example:** Data custodians are notified when data security controls need to be strengthened or have been compromised.

### Data Protection Officers (DPOs)

Data protection officers monitor the internal compliance of an organization’s data protection procedures. They advise the security team on data protection standards and conduct assessments to ensure proper data protection.

**Example:** DPOs are notified when set standards or protocols have been violated.

### Key Takeaways

- Incident escalation involves various members of a security team acting together.
- Entry-level analysts typically escalate incidents to their direct supervisor.
- Understanding the roles and responsibilities of different team members is crucial for recognizing which incidents should be reported to whom.

## Escalation Timing

You previously learned about the potential impact even the smallest incident can have on an organization if the incident is not escalated properly. You also discovered just how important your role as an entry-level analyst will be to the effectiveness of an organization’s escalation process.

This reading will go into more detail about the role you’ll play in protecting an organization’s data and assets when it comes to escalating incidents.

### Your Decisions Matter

Security is a fast-paced environment with bad actors constantly trying to compromise an organization’s systems and data. This means security analysts must be prepared to make daily decisions to help keep a company’s data and systems safe. Entry-level security analysts help the security team escalate potential security incidents to the right team members. A big part of your role as a security analyst will be making decisions about which security events to escalate before they become major security incidents.

### Trust Your Instincts and Ask Questions

Confidence is an important attribute for a security analyst to have, especially when it comes to the escalation process. The security team will depend on you to be confident in your decision-making. You should be intentional about learning the organization’s escalation policy. This will help you gain confidence in making the right decisions when it comes to escalating security events. But remember to ask questions when necessary. It shows that you’re committed to constantly learning the right way to do your job.

### All Security Events Are Not Equal

An important part of escalation is recognizing which assets and data are the most important for your organization. You can determine this information by reading through your onboarding materials, asking your supervisor directly about which assets and data are most important, and reviewing your company’s security policies. When you have that type of understanding, it allows you to recognize when one incident should be given a higher priority over others. You previously learned about the following incident classification types:

- **Malware infections:** Occur when malicious software designed to disrupt a system infiltrates an organization’s computers or network.
    
- **Unauthorized access:** Occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system, data, or application without permission.
    
- **Improper usage:** Occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization’s acceptable use policies.
    

Identifying a specific incident type allows you to properly prioritize and quickly escalate those incidents. Remember, an incident which directly impacts assets that are essential to business operations should always take priority over incidents that do not directly impact business operations. For example, an incident where unauthorized access has been gained to a manufacturing application should take priority over an incident where malware has infected a legacy system that does not impact business operations. As you gain experience in the cybersecurity field, you will learn how to quickly assess the priority levels of incident types.

### Quick Escalation Tips

A big part of your role in cybersecurity will be determining when to escalate a security event. Here are a few tips to help with this:

- Familiarize yourself with the escalation policy of the organization you work for.
- Follow the policy at all times.
- Ask questions.

### Key Takeaways

Incident escalation will be an important part of your role within a security team. Entry-level analysts are expected to identify and escalate incidents related to their daily work. Reading and understanding your organization’s escalation policy will be helpful in this responsibility. The escalation policy will describe how and to whom you should escalate incidents. When in doubt, never be afraid to ask a supervisor about the escalation process. This will help you stay knowledgeable about your job and make informed decisions.
