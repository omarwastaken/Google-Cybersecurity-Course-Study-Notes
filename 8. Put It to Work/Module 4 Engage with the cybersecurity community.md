## Strategies for Engaging with the Cybersecurity Community

You have learned a lot about the security field, from the origins of security and its importance to organizations around the world to recognizing security incidents and communicating with stakeholders.

Security is a rapidly evolving industry, so it’s important to stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. This reading will focus on how to stay engaged with the cybersecurity community after completing this program.

## Security Organizations and Conferences

Attending security conferences and joining organizations gives you the opportunity to gain knowledge from seasoned professionals who are constantly seeking out new ways to improve on their security strategies and techniques.

### Find the Right Organization

What security organization should you join? This question depends on your specific interest in security. Are you someone who wants to focus on reacting to security incidents or preventing them from happening? Are you interested in forensic security or data logging? Do you have aspirations of being a CISO one day? It’s important to have a clear understanding of what your interests are before you narrow down your search for a cybersecurity organization or conference.

### Begin the Search

Once you understand what your interests are, do a web search for organizations or conferences in your area. For example, you can type in “incident response cybersecurity conferences in my area.” This search will give you a list of cybersecurity conferences focused on incident response. If you’re interested in forensic security, you can type “forensic security organizations in my area” or a similar phrase into your web search engine. No matter what your interests are, you can do a web search online to find a cybersecurity organization or conference focused on that area.

### Use Social Media

Social media is another great way to find cybersecurity organizations or conferences. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)®, for example, is a social media platform that connects business professionals with one another. You can use LinkedIn® to find security groups or organizations to join. In the LinkedIn® search bar, you can try search queries such as:

- “Incident response cybersecurity groups”
- “Organizations for cybersecurity analysts”

### Be Aware of Social Engineering

While social media is a good way to connect with other professionals in the security industry, it’s also important to be mindful that hackers use social media to trick users into giving up private information. You've previously learned that social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. To protect yourself from social engineering when using social media to find resources, always remember not to click on unexpected links or attachments sent from unfamiliar users on social media.

### Mailing Lists for Security

Another great way to stay connected with the security industry is to sign up for different cybersecurity mailing lists. These mailing lists send out information periodically on various security topics. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers two cybersecurity mailing lists for you to join:

- A list focused on security threat information, best practices for cybersecurity, and analysis from CISA’s domestic and international security partners
- A list providing weekly summaries of new vulnerabilities that might pose a risk to an organization’s network

## Key Takeaways

Attackers are always developing new ways to compromise corporate and personal data from users. Cybersecurity organizations and conferences are a great way for security professionals to stay up-to-date on the latest news, tools, and trends in the industry. Be sure to find organizations that align with your security interests.

## Connect with Other Cybersecurity Professionals

You’ve learned the importance of staying engaged with the cybersecurity community after completing this certificate program. The security industry is always evolving, so it’s important that security professionals continue to learn about the field.

This reading will focus on providing more tips to help you stay engaged with the security community and advance your career by engaging with the cybersecurity community.

## LinkedIn® with CISOs

Earlier in the program, you learned about Chief Information Security Officers, also known as CISOs. It’s their job to be up-to-date on every aspect of security, including all of the latest trends and news in the security world. With this in mind, it’s a great idea to follow CISOs on LinkedIn® professional networking services. When you follow a CISO on social media, you’ll have an opportunity to discover the kinds of information they share with their audience. That information might provide you with useful tips and relevant news. Staying informed about security news and trends can help progress your cybersecurity career because it helps sharpen your security mindset.

## Finding Other Security Professionals on LinkedIn®

Whether you’d like to connect with other entry-level analysts or more seasoned professionals, LinkedIn® is a great way to connect with others. When connecting with others, it’s important to send a well-written message. This message can help the person understand your intentions. It also helps people determine that you’re not a scammer looking to exploit them. Here are a few tips to help you write your first message in a way that engages and interests the recipient:

- **Use a conversational tone.**
- **Provide a clear reason for wanting to connect.**
- **Avoid spelling and grammatical errors.**

Here is an example of an effective LinkedIn® message to send to a security professional:

> “Hi, Tim. I recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, and I’d like to connect with other security professionals. It seems like you have a lot of experience in the security industry that I can learn from. Let’s keep in touch!”

This example provides a clear reason for why you want to connect with this person and is presented in a conversational tone. You also did not give the impression that you are a scammer by asking the person to do something suspicious to connect with you, like downloading an unusual file attachment.

## Key Takeaways

- **Stay Informed:** Attackers are always developing new ways to compromise corporate and personal data. Connecting with other cybersecurity professionals on social media is a great way to stay ahead of the latest trends in security.
- **Follow CISOs:** CISOs are great professionals to connect with because they are responsible for all aspects of an organization's security. Because of that, CISOs tend to share important security tips, news, and trends on their social media pages that could be valuable to you as a newcomer to the industry.
