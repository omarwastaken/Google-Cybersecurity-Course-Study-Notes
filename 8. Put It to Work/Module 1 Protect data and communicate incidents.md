## Data and Asset Classification

Protecting an organization’s business operations and assets from security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities is important. You previously learned what it means to have a security mindset. That mindset can help you identify and reduce security risks and potential incidents.

In this reading, you will learn about key data classification types and the difference between the low-level and high-level assets of an organization.

### Classifying for Safety

Security professionals classify data types to help them properly protect an organization from cyber attacks that negatively impact business operations. Here is a review of the most common data types:

- Public data
- Private data
- Sensitive data
- Confidential data

#### Public Data

This data classification does not need extra security protections. Public data is already accessible to the public and poses a minimal risk to the organization if viewed or shared by others. Although this data is open to the public, it still needs to be protected from security attacks. Examples of public data include press releases, job descriptions, and marketing materials.

#### Private Data

This data classification type has a higher security level. Private data is information that should be kept from the public. If an individual gains unauthorized access to private data, that event has the potential to pose a serious risk to an organization.

Examples of private data can include company email addresses, employee identification numbers, and an organization’s research data.

#### Sensitive Data

This information must be protected from everyone who does not have authorized access. Unauthorized access to sensitive data can cause significant damage to an organization’s finances and reputation.

Sensitive data includes personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII), and protected health information (PHI). Examples of these types of sensitive data are banking account numbers, usernames and passwords, social security numbers (which U.S. citizens use to report their wages to the government), passwords, passport numbers, and medical information.

#### Confidential Data

This data classification type is important for an organization’s ongoing business operations. Confidential data often has limits on the number of people who have access to it. Access to confidential data sometimes involves the signing of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)—legal contracts that bind two or more parties to protect information—to further protect the confidentiality of the data.

Examples of confidential data include proprietary information such as trade secrets, financial records, and sensitive government data.

### Asset Classification

Asset classification means labelling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. The classification of an organization's assets ranges from low- to high-level.

Public data is a low-level asset. It is readily available to the public and will not have a negative impact on an organization if compromised. Sensitive data and confidential data are high-level assets. They can have a significantly negative impact on an organization if leaked publicly. That negative impact can lead to the loss of a company’s competitive edge, reputation, and customer trust. A company’s website address is an example of a low-level asset. An internal email from that company discussing trade secrets is an example of a high-level asset.

### Key Takeaways

Every company has its own data classification policy that identifies what type of data is in each category. It will be important to your success as a security professional to familiarize yourself with that policy. Understanding different data and asset classification types is important. It helps you prioritize what data needs to be protected most. It also helps you recognize what assets need higher levels of security and what assets need minimal security.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

The role of a security professional is to ensure a company’s data and assets are protected from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. However, sometimes things don’t go as planned. There are times when security incidents happen. Security breaches can lead to financial consequences and the loss of credibility with customers or other businesses in the industry.

This reading will discuss the need to create business continuity and disaster recovery plans to minimize the impact of a security incident on an organization’s business operations. Analysts need to consider the sequence of steps to be taken by the security team before business continuity and disaster recovery plans are implemented.

### Identify and Protect

Creating business continuity and disaster recovery plans are the final steps of a four-part process that most security teams go through to help ensure the security of an organization.

1. **Identify Assets**: The security team identifies the assets that must be protected in the organization.
2. **Determine Threats**: They determine what potential threats could negatively impact those assets.
3. **Implement Detection Tools**: The security team implements tools and processes to detect potential threats to assets.
4. **Create Plans**: The IT or appropriate business function creates the business continuity and disaster recovery plans. These plans are created in conjunction with one another to minimize the impact of a security incident involving one of the organization’s assets.

### Business Continuity Plan

A business continuity plan is a document that outlines the procedures to sustain business operations during and after a significant disruption. It is created alongside a disaster recovery plan to minimize the damage of a successful security attack. Here are four essential steps for business continuity plans:

1. **Conduct a Business Impact Analysis**
    
    - Focuses on the possible effects a disruption of business functions can have on an organization.
2. **Identify, Document, and Implement Steps to Recover Critical Business Functions and Processes**
    
    - Helps the business continuity team create actionable steps toward responding to a security event.
3. **Organize a Business Continuity Team**
    
    - Brings various members of the organization together to help execute the business continuity plan if needed. The members of this team are typically from the cybersecurity, IT, HR, communications, and operations departments.
4. **Conduct Training for the Business Continuity Team**
    
    - The team considers different risk scenarios and prepares for security threats during these training exercises.

### Disaster Recovery Plan

A disaster recovery plan allows an organization’s security team to outline the steps needed to minimize the impact of a security incident, such as a successful ransomware attack that has stopped the manufacturing team from retrieving certain data. It also helps the security team resolve the security threat. A disaster recovery plan is typically created alongside a business continuity plan. Steps to create a disaster recovery plan should include:

1. **Implementing Recovery Strategies to Restore Software**
    
2. **Implementing Recovery Strategies to Restore Hardware Functionality**
    
3. **Identifying Applications and Data that Might Be Impacted after a Security Incident Has Taken Place**
    

### Key Takeaways

Disaster recovery and business continuity plans are important for an organization’s security posture. It’s essential that the security team has plans in place to keep the organization’s business operations moving forward in case a security incident does occur.
