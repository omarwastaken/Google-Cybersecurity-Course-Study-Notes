### The STAR Method

The STAR Method is a technique used to answer behavioral and situational interview questions. Using this method is a great way to help you understand each interview question and provide a thoughtful and thorough response. STAR stands for:

- **Situation**
- **Task**
- **Action**
- **Result**

### Example of STAR Method

**Question:** "Tell me about a time when you encountered a challenge on the job?"

1. **Situation:** Two people needed to stay home for work due to illness, and I was the only person available to assist customers.
2. **Task:** I needed to answer phone calls from customers while assisting shoppers in the store.
3. **Action:** I came up with a strategy that allowed me to assist customers as they entered the store while also ensuring that customers who called were helped or politely placed on hold until I was able to address their needs.
4. **Result:** I managed the in-store operations for the day without many mistakes, and my manager complimented me during the next team meeting.

### Benefits of STAR Method

This example highlights the benefits of answering open-ended interview questions using the STAR method.

### Additional Interview Strategies

#### Answer Questions with Confidence

One way to demonstrate confidence is by admitting when you don't know something. For example, if an interviewer asks you to discuss a skill that you don't have, it's okay to admit you haven't learned it yet. However, confidently mention that while you don't have that particular skill, you're a quick learner and eager to develop it. Treat it as an opportunity to emphasize your ability to adapt and learn on the job.

#### Take Time to Understand Questions

Taking the time to fully understand a problem or question shows confidence. When interviewing, don't be afraid to ask the interviewer for a moment to think about your answer. This shows that you're willing to take the time needed to understand the question and provide a response that is meaningful and relevant.

### Key Takeaways

- Use the STAR method to structure your responses to behavioral and situational questions.
- Demonstrate confidence by admitting gaps in your knowledge while emphasizing your willingness to learn.

## Apply the STAR Method During Interviews

You’ve been learning about different techniques and strategies to use during future interviews for jobs in the cybersecurity field. In this reading, you’ll learn more details about the STAR method for answering interview questions. Implementing this strategy will help you answer interview questions with confidence and clarity.

### The STAR Method

When interviewing for a job, it can be challenging to convey the right details about your professional history and skills to your interviewers. Using the STAR method can help you share your success stories effectively and strategically. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Using this method enables you to describe potential challenges you faced in previous roles and gives you the opportunity to show how you thoughtfully approached solving those problems from start to finish.

### STAR Method Acronym

|**Letter**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|S|Situation|
|T|Task|
|A|Action|
|R|Result|

### Situation

The situation is the project you worked on or a challenge that you had to overcome. For example, perhaps you had to manage a disgruntled customer’s negative feedback about your company, a system error on your work device that slowed down a customer transaction, or being left alone in the office for an extended period of time. Fully describing the situation allows the interviewer to gain a clear understanding of the challenge you had to overcome.

### Task

The task outlines the key responsibilities or role you played in solving the challenge described in the situation phase of the STAR method. Specifying what the task is provides clarity about what your objectives were in this scenario.

### Action

The action describes the exact steps you took to resolve the challenging situation you described in the beginning of the STAR method. The action is crucial to the STAR method because it allows the employer to understand what choices you made to achieve your desired outcome during a real conflict or challenge. Employers want employees who can think fast and make decisions that help solve problems.

### Result

Finally, sharing the result of your challenge or example shows the employers how the situation was resolved as a direct result of the actions you took. When participating in an interview, you want to make sure that any example you give with the STAR method ends in a positive result. Positive results show an employer that you are someone who has demonstrated an ability to successfully resolve issues and may lead an employer to offer you a job. Of course, not all situations have completely positive outcomes; if an employer asks you about a situation that didn’t have a positive outcome, try to focus on what you learned from the situation and how that experience helped you become a better employee.

### Key Takeaways

The STAR method stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Following this method helps you communicate to an employer an example of a challenge you faced in the workplace. Remember to use one of your success stories when using the STAR method on an interview. Challenges arise all the time in the security world, so being able to demonstrate an ability to overcome any type of challenge is a great trait to show off during an interview. Plus, since cybersecurity is such a team-driven industry, being able to communicate effectively to an interviewer will help you be a competitive applicant.

## Learn More About Developing an Elevator Pitch

When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a security professional, and what qualities you’re searching for in a potential job. A simple way to deliver this information succinctly is with an elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a brief summary of your experience, skills, and background that should be communicated in 60 seconds or fewer.

Although an elevator pitch is often specific to an idea or a product, you can also use it to sell yourself as a professional to potential employers. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch can be used to stand out to your interviewer. It can be used to help explain why you’re a good fit for the role or to answer the popular interview question “tell me about yourself.” This reading helps you prepare your elevator pitch to express the value you can provide as an entry-level security analyst or a more experienced cybersecurity professional.

### Provide an Introduction

Start by providing an introduction. Introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background.

For example, you could say, “I want to apply my excellent skills for collaborating with others, and my attention to detail, to help the security team protect company data and assets.” To determine which transferable skills to highlight in your elevator pitch, consider ones that you have already developed and how they might apply to your goals as a security professional, such as problem-solving, communication, and time management.

### Express Your Excitement

This is where you share your passion for the field and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to help an organization defend itself against hackers, mention that. This is also a good time to talk about your goals.

For example, you could say, “I love security because it gives me the opportunity to safeguard valuable information from malicious actors attempting to cause unnecessary harm to people and organizations. Long term, I’d love to develop a security and hacker mindset to play my part in defending against the constantly evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.”

### Communicate Your Interest in the Company

Communicating why you are interested in the company—and not just the role—is a great way to help the interviewer recognize that you are knowledgeable about the company. This helps you to establish a rapport with the interviewer and shows that you’ve done your due diligence before coming to the interview.

For example, if you were interviewing for a position for Google’s security team, you could say, “Being a member of Google’s security team helps protect millions of people’s private and sensitive information. As a long-time Google products user, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be able to help safeguard those products and ensure customers have the best experience possible.”

### Key Takeaways

Creating an elevator pitch that's 60 seconds or fewer is a great tool to use to quickly share who you are. Use an elevator pitch to introduce yourself to career and business connections in the future. You can even use your elevator pitch in other types of situations, like meeting new friends or colleagues.
