## An entry-level analyst's toolkit
Every organization may provide different tools to their security team, depending on their specific needs. Familiarize yourself with industry standard tools to demonstrate your ability to learn new ones in the workplace.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
A **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** tool collects and analyses log data to monitor critical activities within an organization. Logs are records of events that occur in a system. SIEMs reduce the amount of data for analysts to review by providing alerts for specific threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

#### Network Protocol analysers (Packet Sniffers)
A **network protocol analyser** or **packet sniffer** captures and analyses data traffic in a network. It keeps a record of all the data that a computer encounters within an organization's network. Later, you'll practice using common packet sniffer tools.

#### Playbooks
A **playbook** provides steps for handling specific security incidents. They ensure analysts follow proper protocols and procedures. Two examples are:

1. **Chain of Custody**: Documents evidence possession and control during an investigation, ensuring it remains safe and tracked.
2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**: Prioritizes preserving volatile data to maintain its integrity.

## Tools for Protecting Business Operations
Technical skills and tools help security analysts mitigate risks and protect organizations' operations:

### Programming and Databases
**Programming** is a process creating instructions for computers to execute tasks, often using languages like Python or SQL. **Automation** uses technology to reduce human effort in repetitive tasks and minimize errors. SQL interacts with databases containing millions of data points, each being a specific piece of information.

### Operating Systems
An **operating system** acts as an interface between hardware and users. Examples include Linux, macOS, and Windows. Linux is open-source, allowing for public code contributions. A **command line** uses text commands to interact with the computer.

### Web Vulnerabilities and Encryption
A **web vulnerability** is a unique flaw in web applications that could allow unauthorized access or data theft. Stay updated on [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to understand the most critical risks to web apps. **Encryption** ensures confidentiality by converting data into a secure, cryptographically encoded format.

### Security Tools and Technologies
Other tools and technologies include:

1. **Antivirus Software**: Prevents, detects, and eliminates malware and viruses, also known as anti-malware.
2. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Monitors system activity for potential threats, analyzing network packets to identify intrusions.
3. **Penetration Testing**: Simulates attacks to evaluate vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, and applications.

## Creating a Cybersecurity Portfolio
A cybersecurity portfolio showcases your skills and knowledge for potential employers:

### What is a Cybersecurity Portfolio?
Professionals use portfolios to demonstrate their education, skills, and expertise when applying for jobs. It's more in-depth than a resume.

### Options for Creating Your Portfolio
Portfolios can be self-hosted or online:

1. **Documents Folder**: Organize your professional documents on your computer.
2. **Google Drive or Dropbox**: Store and share files on a cloud platform.
3. **Google Sites**: Create responsive, customizable websites to present your portfolio items.
4. **Git Repository**: Use Git to store portfolio projects, such as those from this program.

### Portfolio Projects
Throughout the certificate program, develop portfolio items:

- Draft a professional statement
- Conduct a security audit
- analyse network structure and security
- Manage file permissions using Linux commands
- Apply filters to SQL queries
- Identify vulnerabilities for small businesses
- Document incidents with an incident handler's journal
- Create or revise a resume

**Note**: Do not include private, copyrighted, or proprietary documents. Keep your site private until finalized.
