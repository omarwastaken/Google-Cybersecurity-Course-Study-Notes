## Purpose of security frameworks  
Security frameworks help organizations protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII), secure financial information, identify security weaknesses, manage organizational risks, and align security with business goals. They consist of:  
  
1. Identifying and documenting security goals.  
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals.  
3. Implementing strong security processes.  
4. Monitoring and communicating results.  
  
## CIA triad  
The **CIA (confidentiality, integrity, and availability)** triad is a foundational cybersecurity model that guides organizations in establishing appropriate controls to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. It includes:  
  
- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.  
- **Integrity**: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.  
- **Availability**: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.  
  
## Controls, frameworks, and compliance  
**Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They work together with frameworks to ensure that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements. Security frameworks provide guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.  
  
### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Risk Management Framework (RMF)  
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops voluntary compliance frameworks used worldwide to manage risk, such as the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) and the [NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf).  
  
### FERC-NERC, FedRAMP®, CIS®, GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO, SOC type 1, and SOC type 2  
Other important frameworks, controls, and compliance standards include:  
  
#### FERC-NERC  
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC) regulates organizations involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These entities are required to prepare for, mitigate, and report potential security incidents that could negatively impact the power grid.  
  
#### FedRAMP®  
The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services for the U.S. federal government and third-party providers.  
  
#### CIS®  
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a nonprofit that provides controls to safeguard systems and networks against attacks and offers actionable measures in case of security incidents.  
  
#### GDPR  
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects the processing of EU residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of the EU territory. Organizations must be transparent about held data, inform individuals within 72 hours of a breach.  
  
#### PCI DSS  
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) ensures organizations securely store, accept, process, and transmit credit card information to reduce fraud.  
  
#### HIPAA  
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects patient health information with three rules: Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification. Organizations storing patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of breaches involving their Protected Health Information (PHI).  
  
#### ISO  
ISO establishes international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders to improve organizational processes and procedures.  
  
#### SOC type 1, SOC type 2  
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) developed SOC reports that assess user access policies at various organizational levels for financial compliance and risk management.  
  
### Executive Order 14028  
On May 12, 2021, President Biden released an executive order to improve U.S. cybersecurity, targeting federal agencies and third parties linked to critical infrastructure. Review the [Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) for more information.  
  
## Ethical concepts guiding cybersecurity decisions  
**Security ethics** are guidelines for making ethical decisions as a security professional, emphasizing unbiased, honest, responsible actions with respect to the law and privacy protections.  
  
### Counterattacks and laws  
#### U.S. standpoint on counterattacks  
In the U.S., counterattacks are illegal due to laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. Only federal government employees or military personnel can counterattack. Counterattacking can escalate attacks, causing more harm and potential international implications for hacktivists with political goals.  
  
#### International standpoint on counterattacks  
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) allows counterattacks if:  
1. The counterattack affects only the initial attacker.  
2. It's a direct communication to stop the attack.  
3. It doesn't escalate the situation.  
4. Effects can be reversed.  
Organizations generally don't counterattack due to uncertainty and potential negative outcomes.  
  
### Ethical principles and methodologies  
Ethics in cybersecurity involve confidentiality, privacy protection, and laws:  
  
- **Confidentiality**: Authorized users access specific assets or data, ensuring respect for privacy.  
- **Privacy protection**: Safeguard personal information from unauthorized use (PII, SPII).  
- **Laws**: Remain unbiased, transparent, just, and invest in skills to protect organizations and individuals.  
- For example, HIPAA requires adherence to legal and ethical obligations regarding patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) breaches.
