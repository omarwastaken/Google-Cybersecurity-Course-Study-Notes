## Security Frameworks

**What are Security Frameworks?**

- Frameworks are blueprints or guidelines that organizations use to create their own security plans.
- They help organizations address risks and threats to data, privacy, and physical security.
- Examples of threats covered by frameworks include social engineering attacks (like phishing) and ransomware.

**Benefits of Security Frameworks**

- Frameworks provide a common language for discussing security within an organization.
- They help ensure all areas of security are considered, including:
    - Data security
    - Physical security (e.g., building access control)
    - Employee security awareness training

**Key Points about Security Frameworks**

- Frameworks can be used to create plans for:
    - **Preventing security breaches** (e.g., by educating employees about phishing attempts).
    - **Detecting security breaches** (e.g., by having procedures for identifying suspicious activity).
    - **Responding to security breaches** (e.g., by having a plan for containing and mitigating damage).
- Security frameworks are essential because people are often the weakest link in an organization's security posture.
- By educating employees and creating a culture of security awareness, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of security incidents.

**Security Analyst's Role**

- Security analysts need to understand and implement the security frameworks used by their organization.
- This includes knowing how to:
    - Recognize red flags (potential security threats).
    - Report security concerns promptly.
    - Follow the organization's security protocols for handling security incidents.

## Security Controls

**What are Security Controls?**

- Security controls are specific actions or tools used to reduce security risks.
- They are implemented alongside security frameworks to achieve an organization's security goals.
- Without proper controls, organizations are exposed to risks that can lead to financial losses and reputational damage.
- Examples of risks mitigated by controls include unauthorized access to systems (trespassing), fake employee accounts, and unauthorized use of benefits.

**Types of Security Controls**

We focus on three common security controls:

1. **Encryption:**
    
    - Process of converting readable data into an unreadable format (ciphertext).
    - Protects the confidentiality of sensitive data (e.g., customer information, Social Security numbers).
2. **Authentication:**
    
    - Process of verifying a user's identity.
    - Examples: usernames and passwords, multifactor authentication (MFA).
    - MFA requires additional verification beyond a password (e.g., security code, fingerprint scan).
3. **Authorization:**
    
    - Process of granting access to specific resources within a system.
    - Ensures users only have access to what they need to perform their jobs.
    - Example: An entry-level security analyst might have access to specific government data, but not all data.

**Security Controls and the CIA Triad**

- The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is a core security model.
- Security controls are used to implement the principles of the CIA triad.
- The next video will discuss the CIA triad in more detail.

**Remember:**

- Security controls are essential for mitigating risks and protecting sensitive data.
- Different controls address different types of risks.

##  Security Frameworks and Controls Working Together

**Security Frameworks and Controls: A Powerful Combination**

This section explains how security frameworks and controls work together to manage risk and improve an organization's security posture.

**What are Security Frameworks?**

- Frameworks are blueprints that organizations use to create security plans.
- They help organizations mitigate risks and threats to data, privacy, and comply with regulations.
- Example: HIPAA compliance in healthcare requires protecting patient information.

**What are Security Controls?**

- Controls are specific actions or tools used to reduce security risks.
- They are implemented alongside frameworks to achieve security goals.
- Example: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a control that helps hospitals comply with HIPAA by strengthening patient record access security.

**Specific Frameworks and Controls**

- Many frameworks and controls exist to address security needs and regulations.
    - **Cyber Threat Framework (CTF):** Provides a common language for communicating cyber threats, allowing for better analysis and response.
    - **International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001:** An internationally recognized framework that outlines information security management best practices and controls. Organizations can choose controls from this framework to improve their security posture.

**Types of Security Controls**

- Controls can be physical, technical, or administrative.
    - **Physical Controls:** Fences, security guards, access cards.
    - **Technical Controls:** Firewalls, MFA, antivirus software.
    - **Administrative Controls:** Separation of duties, authorization, asset classification.

**How Controls Support Frameworks**

- Controls are implemented to fulfil the objectives outlined in security frameworks.
- Example: Using MFA aligns with a healthcare framework's goal of protecting patient data confidentiality.

**Benefits of Frameworks and Controls**

- Together, frameworks and controls help organizations:
    - Manage security risks effectively.
    - Achieve their security goals.
    - Comply with relevant laws and regulations.

**Remember:** Frameworks and controls are essential for creating a strong security posture. While often voluntary, they are highly recommended to safeguard an organization's critical assets.

## CIA Triad: A Foundation for Security

The CIA triad is a fundamental security model that helps organizations understand and manage risks associated with data and critical assets.

**What is the CIA Triad?**

The CIA triad consists of three core principles:

1. **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users should be able to access sensitive data. Information should be shared on a "need-to-know" basis.
2. **Integrity:** Data must be accurate, complete, and trustworthy. Security professionals need to be able to verify the integrity of data to determine its reliability.
3. **Availability:** Authorized users must be able to access data and systems when they need them. Inaccessible data hinders operations and prevents users from completing their jobs.

**The CIA Triad in Action**

- **Example: Banks**
    - Confidentiality: Banks need to keep customer financial information confidential.
    - Integrity: Banks monitor transactions for suspicious activity to ensure the integrity of financial data.
    - Availability: Banks strive to ensure customers can easily access their accounts online while protecting them from unauthorized access.

**Benefits of Understanding the CIA Triad**

- As a security analyst, you will constantly refer to the CIA triad principles when making security decisions.
- Understanding the CIA triad helps you:
    - Protect sensitive data and assets from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities (including social engineering, malware, and data theft).
    - Make informed decisions about security controls and procedures.

**Implementing the CIA Triad**

- **Confidentiality:** The principle of least privilege can be used to limit user access to only the data they need to perform their jobs.
- **Integrity:** Cryptography (e.g., encryption) can be used to ensure data authenticity and prevent unauthorized tampering.
- **Availability:** Organizations can allow remote access to internal networks while still adhering to confidentiality principles by using access controls. Authorized users will only have access to the data they need to perform their jobs.

**Key Takeaways**

The CIA triad is essential for establishing an organization's security posture. Knowing what it is and how it's applied can help you better understand how security teams work to protect organizations and the people they serve.

## NIST Frameworks: A Foundation for Security

This video introduces two important frameworks created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture.

**What are NIST Frameworks?**

- NIST frameworks are voluntary, non-prescriptive guides that organizations can use to develop security plans.
- They are relevant to for-profit, non-profit, and government organizations worldwide.
- NIST frameworks help organizations manage cybersecurity risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

**Key NIST Frameworks**

1. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):**
    
    - A widely respected framework that provides standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks.
    - It consists of five core functions that guide a holistic approach to cybersecurity:
        - **Identify:** Focuses on identifying cybersecurity risks and how they can impact an organization's people, assets, and data (e.g., security analysts monitoring internal networks).
        - **Protect:** Involves implementing security policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats (e.g., security analysts updating policies based on new threats).
        - **Detect:** Focuses on identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase detection speed and efficiency (e.g., security analysts reviewing security tools for proper configuration).
        - **Respond:** Involves taking steps to contain, neutralize, and analyse security incidents, while also implementing improvements to security processes (e.g., security analysts working with a team to collect data, document incidents, and suggest preventative measures).
        - **Recover:** Focuses on restoring affected systems and data back to normal operation (e.g., security analysts assisting the team in restoring systems and critical assets impacted by a breach).
2. **NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53:**
    
    - A framework specifically designed to protect the security of information systems within the U.S. federal government.
    - It applies to both government systems and systems provided by private companies for government use.
    - This framework helps maintain the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, and availability) for government information systems.

**Benefits of NIST Frameworks**

- NIST frameworks provide a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management.
- They help organizations implement proactive and reactive security measures through the five functions of the NIST CSF.
- Understanding these frameworks is essential for security analysts as they help organizations improve their security posture, minimize risks, and effectively respond to incidents.

**Remember:** Security incidents are inevitable. However, by using the NIST CSF framework and its five functions, organizations can improve their ability to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents, ultimately minimizing damage.

## OWASP Security Principles for Security Analysts

This reading expands on the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), recently renamed Open Worldwide Application Security Project® (OWASP), security principles you learned about previously. Understanding and applying these principles is essential for entry-level security analysts.

**OWASP Security Principles in Practice**

Security principles are embedded in your daily tasks as a security analyst. These principles are applied whether you are:

- Analysing logs
- Monitoring a security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard
- Using a vulnerability scanner

**Core OWASP Security Principles**

- **Minimize Attack Surface Area:** Reduce the number of potential entry points attackers can exploit (e.g., disable unnecessary software features, restrict access to assets, enforce strong passwords).
- **Principle of The Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum access required for their jobs (e.g., an entry-level analyst may have access to log data but not user permission controls). This principle limits potential damage from a security breach.
- **Defence in Depth:** Implement multiple security controls to address various threats and risks (e.g., multifactor authentication (MFA), firewalls, intrusion detection systems). This creates multiple hurdles for attackers to overcome.
- **Separation of Duties:** Distribute tasks across multiple roles to prevent unauthorized activities (e.g., the person approving financial transactions should not be the same person who prepares them).
- **Keep Security Simple:** Avoid overly complex security controls that become difficult to manage and hinder collaboration. Security solutions should be user-friendly to encourage proper implementation.
- **Fix Security Issues Correctly:** When security incidents occur, identify the root cause promptly. This involves patching vulnerabilities, implementing fixes, and testing repairs for effectiveness (e.g., fixing a weak Wi-Fi password vulnerability might involve enforcing stricter password policies).

**Additional OWASP Security Principles**

- **Establish Secure Defaults:** The optimal security state of an application should be its default state for users. Extra work should be required to make the application insecure.
- **Fail Securely:** When a security control fails, it should default to its most secure option. For example, a failing firewall should close all connections and block new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
- **Don't Trust Services:** Many organizations work with third-party partners with different security policies. Don't explicitly trust that their partners' systems are secure. (e.g., an airline should verify reward point balances before sharing information with customers from a third-party vendor).
- **Avoid Security by Obscurity:** The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016): “The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defence in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.”

**Benefits of Understanding OWASP Principles**

- Improves overall security knowledge
- Helps security analysts stand out in the job market
- Provides a foundation for implementing effective security measures

**Remember:** OWASP principles complement NIST frameworks and the CIA triad to create a well-rounded approach to organizational security.

**Incorporating Security Principles**

Cybersecurity professionals constantly apply security principles to safeguard organizations and the people they serve. As an entry-level security analyst, you can leverage these principles to promote secure development practices that reduce risks to companies and users alike.

## Security Audits: An Essential Guide for Entry-Level Security Analysts

This comprehensive study guide combines key takeaways from two lectures on security audits, providing a foundation for entry-level security analysts.

**What is a Security Audit?**

A security audit is a formal review process that evaluates an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of predetermined expectations. These audits are independent reviews, assessing compliance with both internal and external criteria.

- **Internal Criteria:** Established policies, procedures, and best practices of the organization.
- **External Criteria:** Regulatory compliance with laws and federal regulations.

Security audits also assess the effectiveness of implemented security controls, which are safeguards designed to mitigate specific security risks. Regular audits (e.g., daily security information and event management (SIEM) dashboard monitoring) help identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, maintaining an organization's overall security posture. In the event of security issues, a remediation process must be established to address them.

**Goals and Objectives of a Security Audit**

The primary goal of a security audit is to ensure an organization's IT practices meet industry and organizational security standards. The objectives focus on identifying areas for improvement and addressing them. Audits provide clear direction by:

- Highlighting current security shortcomings
- Developing a plan to rectify those shortcomings

Security audits are crucial for safeguarding data and avoiding penalties from regulatory bodies. The frequency of audits depends on local laws and relevant compliance regulations.

**Factors Affecting Security Audits**

Several factors influence the types of audits an organization implements, including:

- Industry type
- Organization size
- Applicable government regulations
- Geographic location
- Decisions to adhere to specific compliance regulations

For a more in-depth exploration of common compliance regulations, refer to the course reading on controls, frameworks, and compliance.

**The Role of Frameworks and Controls in Audits**

Frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the ISO 27000 international standard for information security provide a foundation for organizations to prepare for security audits and achieve regulatory compliance. Adherence to these frameworks can streamline internal and external audits. Additionally, frameworks, used in conjunction with controls, can help organizations align with regulatory requirements and standards.

There are three main categories of controls to be reviewed during an audit:

- **Administrative/Managerial Controls:** Policies and procedures related to human aspects of cybersecurity (e.g., password policies).
- **Technical Controls:** Hardware and software solutions to protect assets (e.g., intrusion detection systems (IDS), encryption).
- **Physical Controls:** Measures to prevent physical access to protected assets (e.g., surveillance cameras, locks).

## Control categories

### Control categories

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

● Administrative/Managerial controls

● Technical controls

● Physical controls

**Administrative/Managerial controls** address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.

**Technical controls** consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

**Physical controls** include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

### Control types

Control types include, but are not limited to:

1. Preventative
2. Corrective
3. Detective
4. Deterrent

These controls work together to provide defence in depth and protect assets. **Preventative controls** are designed to prevent an incident from occurring in the first place. **Corrective controls** are used to restore an asset after an incident. **Detective controls** are implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress. **Deterrent controls** are designed to discourage attacks.

Review the following charts for specific details about each type of control and its purpose.

|**Administrative Controls**|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Control Name**|**Control Type**|**Control Purpose**|
|Least Privilege|Preventative|Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts|
|Disaster recovery plans|Corrective|Provide business continuity|
|Password policies|Preventative|Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attack techniques|
|Access control policies|Preventative|Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data|
|Account management policies|Preventative|Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting overall impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage|
|Separation of duties|Preventative|Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts|

**Security Audit Checklist**

Creating a comprehensive audit checklist is essential before conducting an audit. The checklist typically covers the following areas:

- **Audit Scope:**
    - Assets to be assessed (e.g., firewall configuration, PII security, physical asset security).
    - How the audit contributes to achieving organizational goals.
    - Frequency of audits.
    - Evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to ensure effectiveness and implementation.
- **Risk Assessment:**
    - Evaluation of identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (regulations).
- **Audit Conduct:**
    - Internal audits assess the security of assets identified within the audit scope.
- **Mitigation Plan:**
    - Develop a strategy to reduce risk levels and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that could negatively impact the organization's security posture.
- **Communication of Results:**
    - Provide a detailed report of findings, suggested security improvements, and applicable compliance regulations.

**Key Takeaways**

This comprehensive guide has equipped you with a solid understanding of security audits, including their purpose, types, and the role of frameworks, controls, and compliance. While there's more to learn about security audits, this foundation will prepare you to participate in future audits and contribute to your organization's overall security posture.
