## Security Playbooks

This video introduces security playbooks as an essential tool for cybersecurity professionals. Playbooks outline procedures for responding to security incidents effectively.

**What is a Playbook?**

- A manual providing details and procedures for operational actions.
- In cybersecurity, playbooks specify tools and actions to take in response to security incidents.
- Playbooks promote consistent and efficient responses regardless of the responding personnel.

**Types of Playbooks**

- Incident Response Playbooks (focus of this video)
- Security Alert Playbooks
- Team-Specific Playbooks
- Product-Specific Playbooks

**Incident Response Playbook Phases**

1. **Preparation:** Mitigate risk by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and training users. This sets the foundation for effective response (e.g., creating incident response plans outlining team member roles and responsibilities).
2. **Detection and Analysis:** Use defined processes and technology to identify and analyse security events. This helps determine if a breach occurred and its potential impact.
3. **Containment:** Prevent further damage and minimize the immediate impact of the security incident. This is a high priority to prevent ongoing risks.
4. **Eradication and Recovery:** Completely remove the incident's artifacts and restore normal operations. This involves eliminating malicious code, mitigating vulnerabilities, and restoring affected systems to a secure state (IT restoration).
5. **Post-Incident Activity:** Document the incident, inform leadership, and apply lessons learned to improve future preparedness. This may involve a full-scale analysis to determine the root cause and implement security posture improvements.
6. **Coordination:** Report incidents and share information throughout the response process according to organizational standards. This ensures compliance and facilitates coordinated response and resolution.

**The Connection Between SIEM Tools and Playbooks**

- SIEM tools collect and analyse data to detect threats and generate security alerts.
- Security analysts use these alerts to trigger the appropriate playbook, guiding their response to potential incidents.
- SIEM tools and playbooks work together to provide a structured and efficient incident response process.

**Playbook Overview**

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as responding to security incidents. Playbooks are living documents updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. They include strategies, expectations for team members, plans, and are managed collaboratively.

**Types of Playbooks**

Playbooks can cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities like ransomware, vishing, or business email compromise (BEC). Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are common, developed based on an organization’s business continuity plan.

**Key Takeaways**

- Playbooks are crucial for effective security incident response.
- Incident response playbooks outline a six-phase process for handling security incidents.
- Playbooks are living documents that evolve with industry changes and new threats.
- Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are essential for adhering to legal and organizational standards and protocols.

## Playbooks, SIEM Tools, and SOAR Tools

### Playbooks Overview

- **Definition:** Playbooks are detailed manuals that guide cybersecurity teams in responding to security incidents.
- **Purpose:** Ensure consistent actions are taken in a prescribed manner, regardless of the personnel involved.
- **Contents:** Detailed flow charts, tables, and instructions outlining specific actions and their order.
- **Types:** Incident-specific playbooks for various security incidents like ransomware attacks.

### Playbooks and SIEM Tools

- **Integration:** Playbooks are used alongside SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.
- **Function:** When a SIEM tool flags an unusual event (e.g., user behaviour), playbooks provide instructions for addressing the issue.
- **Example:** Playbooks assist in recovery procedures during ransomware attacks by specifying actions and responsibilities.

### Playbooks and SOAR Tools

- **Integration:** Playbooks are utilized with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools.
- **Function:** SOAR tools automate repetitive tasks generated by tools like SIEM or MDR (Managed Detection and Response).
- **Example:** A SOAR tool automatically blocks a user account after multiple failed login attempts, and analysts then refer to playbooks for further resolution steps.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Role of Playbooks:** Provide detailed actions for security teams during incidents.
2. **Consistency and Efficiency:** Ensure consistent response regardless of personnel, reducing incident impact and asset damage risk.
3. **Integration with Tools:** Work alongside SIEM and SOAR tools to automate and guide incident response effectively.
4. **Importance of Documentation:** Playbooks, also known as runbooks, are critical for incident response planning and execution.
