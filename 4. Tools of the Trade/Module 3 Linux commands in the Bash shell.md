## Navigating the Linux File System: A Security Analyst's Guide

This section equips security professionals with the skills to navigate the Linux file system, a crucial aspect of security tasks.

### Understanding the File System Hierarchy

- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) organizes data within the Linux operating system.
- Everything in Linux is essentially a file stored somewhere in the directory structure.
- The FHS resembles a hierarchical tree structure, with the root directory acting as the base (represented by a single slash `/`).
- Subdirectories branch out from the root, forming a tree-like structure.
- Understanding this structure is essential for navigating to locate and analyse files, especially security-related logs.

### Essential File System Navigation Commands

- **pwd:** Prints the current working directory's path on the screen.
- **ls:** Lists the contents (files and subdirectories) of the current working directory.
- **cd:** Changes the working directory.

### Practical Examples using Bash Shell

- The `pwd` command shows the current directory (e.g., `/home/analyst`).
- The `ls` command displays the contents of the current directory (e.g., directories: logs, oldreports, projects, reports; file: updates.txt).
- The `cd` command is used to navigate between directories (e.g., `cd logs` to change the working directory to the "logs" subdirectory).

### Reading File Content

- Security analysts frequently need to read file content for various purposes (e.g., checking configurations for vulnerabilities, investigating unauthorized access).
    
- Common commands for reading file content include:
    
    - **cat:** Displays the entire content of a file.
    - **head:** Displays the beginning of a file (default: 10 lines).
    

**Example:**

- Reading the entire content of `access.txt` using `cat access.txt`.
- Viewing only the first 10 lines of `access.txt` using `head access.txt`.

### Key Takeaways

- Navigating the Linux file system is a fundamental skill for security professionals.
- Understanding the hierarchical structure and using essential commands like `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` empowers you to locate and manage files effectively.

## Mastering Navigation and File Reading in Linux: A Security Analyst's Guide

This session strengthens your foundation in navigating the Linux file system and reading file content, essential skills for security professionals.

### Understanding the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)

- The FHS dictates how data is organized within the Linux operating system.
- It defines a hierarchical structure using directories and subdirectories.
- A file path specifies the location of a file, with each level separated by a forward slash (`/`).

### Key FHS Directories

- **/ (root directory):** The highest level directory in the system.
- **/home:** Contains individual user directories (e.g., `/home/analyst`).
- **/bin:** Stores binary files and executables (programs).
- **/etc:** Houses system configuration files.
- **/tmp:** Stores temporary files (caution: vulnerable to modification by anyone in the system).
- **/mnt:** Stores mount points for external media (e.g., USB drives).

**Tip:** Use `man hier` to explore the FHS and its directories in more detail.

### User Directories and File Paths

- User directories reside under **/home** (e.g., `/home/analyst`).
- The tilde (`~`) represents the current user's home directory (e.g., `~/logs` is equivalent to `/home/analyst/logs`).
- Absolute file paths start from the root directory (e.g., `/home/analyst/projects`).
- Relative file paths start from the current directory (e.g., `../projects` to go up one level).

### Essential Navigation Commands

- **pwd:** Prints the current working directory's path (e.g., use `whoami` to find your username and corresponding home directory).
- **ls:** Lists the contents of the current working directory (directories and files). You can specify a directory path to list its contents (e.g., `ls /home/analyst/projects`).
- **cd:** Changes the working directory. Use subdirectory names or absolute/relative paths for navigation (e.g., `cd projects` or `cd /home/analyst/logs`).
    
    - Use `cd ..` to move up one directory level (e.g., from `/home/analyst/projects` to `/home/analyst`).
    

### Common Commands for Reading File Content

- **cat:** Displays the entire content of a file (e.g., `cat updates.txt`).
- **head:** Displays the beginning of a file (default: 10 lines) (e.g., `head updates.txt` shows the first 10 lines).
    
    - Use `-n` with `head` to specify the number of lines (e.g., `head -n 5 updates.txt` for the first five lines).
    
- **tail:** Displays the end of a file (default: 10 lines) (e.g., `tail updates.txt` shows the last 10 lines).
    
    - Use `tail` to monitor log files for recent activity.
    
- **less:** Displays the content of a file one page at a time, allowing you to navigate through it (e.g., `less updates.txt`).
    
    - Use Space bar to move forward one page, `b` to go back one page, arrow keys to navigate line by line, and `q` to quit.
    

### Key Takeaways

- Navigating the Linux file system using the FHS structure is crucial for security professionals.
- Mastering commands like `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` empowers you to locate and access files effectively.

- Security analysts frequently need to search for specific information within the system to investigate threats and solve problems.
- Filtering involves searching for particular strings of characters that can aid in tasks like malware detection.
- Linux provides a foundation for basic filtering before exploring techniques like filtering databases with SQL.

### Filtering with grep

- The `grep` command searches a specified file for lines containing a given string.
- **Example:**
    
    - File: `updates.txt`
    - Search string: `"OS"`
    - Command: `grep OS updates.txt` (This returns all lines containing "OS" from `updates.txt`).
    

### Filtering with Pipes

- Pipes (represented by `|`) send the output of one command as input to another command for further processing.
- Imagine pipes as a channel: output from one command flows into the pipe and becomes the input for the next command.

### Combining grep with Pipes for Advanced Filtering

- The power of `grep` can be amplified by using pipes.
- **Example:**
    
    2. `ls reports/` (This lists the contents of the "reports" directory).
    4. Pipe (`|`) sends this output to `grep users`.
    
    - The piped output (directory listing) becomes the input for `grep`.
    - `grep users` searches the directory listing for entries containing "users".
    - The final output displays only files/directories with "users" in their names.
    

**Benefits:**

- Pipes enable you to filter the output of one command using another command like `grep`.
- This refines your search results, providing more targeted information.

### Practical Example in Bash

- We can use `ls` to see all files in the "reports" directory.
- Combining `ls reports/` with `| grep users` filters the output to show only entries containing "users".

### Key Takeaways

- Filtering with `grep` and pipes empowers security professionals to efficiently locate specific information within the Linux system.
- These techniques are crucial for tasks like malware detection, log analysis, and security investigations.

## Mastering Information Filtering in Linux: A Security Analyst's Guide

- Criteria for filtering can include file extensions, text patterns, and modification times.

### Recap: grep for Text Search

- The `grep` command searches a specified file for lines containing a given string.
    
    - Example: `grep OS updates.txt` searches for lines containing "OS" in the "updates.txt" file.
    

### Pipes: Streamlining Filtering

- Pipes (represented by `|`) send the output of one command as input to another command for further processing.
- This allows you to refine your search results by chaining commands.

**Example: Filtering Directory Names with grep**

- `ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users`
    
    2. `ls /home/analyst/reports` lists the contents of the "reports" directory.
    4. Pipe (`|`) sends this output (directory listing) to `grep users`.
    6. `grep users` searches the listing for entries containing "users".
    
    - The final output displays only files/directories with "users" in their names.
    

### The find Command: Powerful Search Capabilities

- The `find` command searches for directories and files based on a wide range of criteria.
- You can specify criteria like:
    
    - Presence of a specific string in the name (`-name`, `-iname`)
    - File size
    - Last modification time (`-mtime`)
    

**Using find:**

- The first argument after `find` specifies the starting search directory (e.g., `/home/analyst/projects`).
- The second argument indicates your search criteria (options and search terms).

**Example: Finding Log Files**

- `find /home/analyst/projects -name "*log*"` searches for all files in the "projects" directory containing "log" in their names (case-sensitive with `-name`).
- `find /home/analyst/projects -iname "*log*"` (not case-sensitive) would also return files named "Log" or "LOG".

**Example: Finding Recently Modified Files**

- `find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3` searches for all files and directories in "projects" modified within the past three days (use `-mtime +1` for more than a day ago, `-mtime -1` for less than a day ago).

**Tip:** The asterisk (`*`) acts as a wildcard, representing zero or more unknown characters.

### Key Takeaways

- Mastering filtering commands like `grep`, pipes (`|`), and `find` empowers you to efficiently locate and analyse critical information within the Linux file system.
- These skills are fundamental for security professionals in tasks like malware detection, log analysis, and security investigations.

- Proper organization simplifies tasks like detecting security issues and safeguarding sensitive data.

### Directories: Building Blocks of Organization

- Directories (analogous to folders) act as containers for files and subdirectories.
- They establish a hierarchical structure within the file system, resembling a tree with branches.

### Essential File Management Commands

- **mkdir:** Creates a new directory (e.g., `mkdir drafts`).
- **rmdir:** Removes an empty directory (e.g., `rmdir oldreports`).
- **touch:** Creates a new empty file (e.g., `touch report.txt`).
- **rm:** Removes a file (e.g., `rm memo.txt`).
- **mv:** Moves a file or directory to a new location (e.g., `mv email_policy.txt drafts`).
- **cp:** Copies a file or directory to a new location (e.g., `cp vulnerabilities.txt projects`).

**Key Points:**

- `rmdir` provides a safety measure by warning you before deleting non-empty directories.
- `mv` and `cp` require two arguments: the file/directory to move/copy and the destination path.

### Practical Examples

- We created a new directory named `drafts` for storing report drafts.
- We used `touch` to create new files named `email_patches.txt` and `OS_patches.txt`.
- We demonstrated how to move the `email_policy.txt` file from the `reports` directory to the `drafts` directory using `mv`.
- We copied the `vulnerabilities.txt` file from `reports` to the `projects` directory using `cp`, ensuring the original file remains in `reports`.

### File Editing with nano

- Text editors like `nano` allow you to create and modify the content of files.
- We used `nano OS_patches.txt` to open the file for editing and added the title "OS Patches".

### Key Takeaways

- **touch:** Creates new empty files (e.g., `touch config.txt`).
- **rm:** Removes files (e.g., `rm login_history.txt`).
- **mv:** Moves files/directories (e.g., `mv system_log.txt backups`).
- **cp:** Copies files/directories (e.g., `cp permissions.txt new_directory`).

**Tips:**

- Use `ls` to confirm directory/file creation or removal.
- `rmdir` cannot remove non-empty directories.
- `mv` can also rename files by specifying a new name in the second argument (e.g., `mv old_name.txt new_name.txt`).

### nano Text Editor

- `nano` is a user-friendly text editor for creating and modifying files.
- **Opening Existing Files:**
    
    - `nano filename.txt` (from the directory containing the file).
    - Specify the absolute path if not in the current directory.
    
- **Creating New Files:**
    
    - `nano new_file.txt` creates the file and opens it for editing.
    
- **Saving and Exiting:**
    
    - Ctrl+O: Save (confirm filename).
    - Ctrl+X: Exit.
    

**Alternatives:** Vim and Emacs are other popular text editors.

### Standard Output Redirection

- Standard output (information returned by the OS) can be redirected to files.
- **Echo Command:** Used for writing simple text to files.
- **Redirection Operators:**
    
    - `>` (right angle bracket): Overwrites existing file content.
    - `>>` (double right angle bracket): Appends content to the end of the file (doesn't overwrite).
    

**Examples:**

- `echo "Last Updated" >> permissions.txt` (adds text to the file).
- `echo "New Data" > permissions.txt` (overwrites existing content).

**Caution:** Use `>` carefully; overwritten files are difficult to recover.

- Both `>` and `>>` create a new file if it doesn't exist.

### Key Takeaways

Security analysts leverage file management commands and text editors like `nano` to organize and modify files effectively. Additionally, standard output redirection with `>` and `>>` provides another way to write content to files in Linux.

## Understanding File Permissions in Linux: A Security Analyst's Guide

This session explores file and directory permissions in Linux, a fundamental concept for security professionals responsible for protecting sensitive data.

### Permissions: The Cornerstone of Access Control

- Permissions define the access granted to users for files and directories.
- They determine who can view, modify, or execute the contents.
- Authorization, the process of granting access, relies on permissions to limit who can interact with specific resources.

### Three Permission Types

- **Read:** Allows viewing file content (directories) or listing directory contents.
- **Write:** Allows modifying file content or creating new files within directories.
- **Execute:** Allows executing a file (if it's an executable program) or entering a directory.

### Permission Ownership

- Permissions apply to three user categories:
    
    - **User:** The file owner (typically the one who created it).
    - **Group:** A group of users the file owner can assign permissions to.
    - **Other:** All other users on the system.
    

### Permission Representation

- Permissions are represented by a 10-character string, for example: `drwxrwxrwx`.
    
    - The first character indicates the file type (e.g., `d` for directory, `-` for regular file).
    - The next three characters represent the user's permissions (read, write, execute, denoted by `r`, `w`, and `x`, or `-` if absent).
    - The following three characters represent the group's permissions (read, write, execute).
    - The final three characters represent the permissions for all other users.
    

### Importance of Proper Permissions

- Setting appropriate permissions is crucial for data security.
- Granting excessive permissions (e.g., world-writable files) can create security vulnerabilities.
    
    - Example: Unauthorized access to payroll data if permissions allow users outside the payroll group to read it.
    

### Checking Permissions with `ls` Commands

- The `ls` command with options allows you to view file permissions and ownership details.
    
    - `ls -l`: Displays detailed information about files, including permissions.
    - `ls -a`: Displays hidden files along with their permissions (filenames starting with a period).
    - `ls -la`: Combines both options, showing permissions for all files, including hidden ones.
    

### Key Takeaways

- Understanding file permissions empowers security analysts to manage access control and safeguard sensitive information.
- By using `ls` commands with appropriate options, you can effectively view and verify file permissions in Linux.

## Mastering File Permissions with chmod in Linux: A Security Analyst's Guide

    - User department changes or project reassignments.
    - The need to safeguard system files from unauthorized access.
    

### chmod: The Permission Changer

- `chmod` stands for "change mode" and alters permissions for files and directories.
- There are two modes for changing permissions, but we'll focus on the user-friendly symbolic mode.

### chmod Breakdown with an Example

**Command Structure:**

```
chmod <permission_changes> <file_or_directory>
```

- `<permission_changes>`: Defines how to modify permissions (explained below).
- `<file_or_directory>`: Specifies the target file or directory.

**Example: Adjusting Permissions for `access.txt`**

```
chmod g+w,o-r access.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `g+w`: Adds write permissions (indicated by `w`) to the group (`g`).
- `,o-r`: Separates group and other permission changes with a comma.
- `o-r`: Removes read permission (indicated by `-`) from "other" (`o`).

**Understanding Symbolic Notation:**

- `u`: Represents the user (owner).
- `g`: Represents the group.
- `o`: Represents other users.
- `+`: Adds permissions.
- `-`: Removes permissions.
- `r`: Represents read permission.
- `w`: Represents write permission.
- `x`: Represents execute permission.

**Key Takeaways:**

- `chmod` empowers security analysts to manage file access control dynamically.

    - The next three characters represent the group's permissions (read, write, execute).
    - The final three characters represent permissions for all other users.
    

### Ownership Categories

- Permissions apply to three user categories:
    
    - User: The file owner (typically the one who created it).
    - Group: A group of users assigned permissions by the owner.
    - Other: All other users on the system.
    

### Exploring Permissions with `ls`

- The `ls` command with options allows you to view file permissions and ownership details.
    
    - `ls -l`: Displays detailed information about files, including permissions.
    - `ls -a`: Displays hidden files along with their permissions (filenames starting with a period).
    - `ls -la`: Combines both options, showing permissions for all files, including hidden ones.
    

### Principle of Least Privilege

- The principle of least privilege grants users only the minimal permissions required for their tasks.
- This minimizes security risks associated with excessive permissions.

### Changing Permissions with `chmod`

- The `chmod` command modifies permissions for files and directories.

### chmod Breakdown

**Command Structure:**

```
chmod <permission_changes> <file_or_directory>

    - New employees joining the organization.
    - Users requiring access due to role changes or departmental transfers.
    
- **Deleting Users:**
    
    - Former employees who no longer need access.
    - Users who have transitioned to different groups within the system.
    

### The Root User: Superpowers with Caution

- The root user, also known as the superuser, possesses extensive privileges to modify the system.
- Regular users have limited permissions for enhanced security.

### Potential Issues with Root Access

- **Security Risks:** The root account is a prime target for malicious actors due to its power.
- **Accidental Mistakes:** Typos or errors can have severe consequences with root privileges, like permanent data deletion.
- **Lack of Accountability:** Tracing actions performed by the root user becomes difficult in a multi-user environment.

### Introducing sudo: A Secure Alternative

- sudo (superuser do) allows executing commands with elevated privileges without logging in as root.
- This provides a more controlled approach compared to full root access.
- sudo prompts you for your current user's password for authorization.

### Granting sudo Access

- Not all users can become sudoers.
- System administrators configure the sudoers file to grant specific users sudo privileges.

### Adding Users with useradd

- useradd is a command for adding new users to the system.
- Only root or sudoers can execute useradd.

**Example:** Adding a new sales representative named `salesrep7`

```
sudo useradd salesrep7
```

### Deleting Users with userdel

- userdel is a command for removing users from the system.
- Similar to useradd, it requires root or sudo privileges.

**Example:** Deleting the user `salesrep7` (assuming they left the company)

```
sudo userdel salesrep7
```

### Key Takeaways

- User management is essential for maintaining system security.
- Use `useradd` to add new users and `userdel` to remove them, both requiring sudo privileges.
- sudo offers a secure alternative to directly using the root account, promoting responsible use of elevated permissions.

## Responsible sudo Usage and Advanced User Management in Linux

This session delves deeper into secure user and file management in Linux, emphasizing responsible use of `sudo` and introducing additional commands for managing user accounts and file ownership.

- **Security Risks of Root Access:** Logging in as the root user is discouraged due to:
    
    - Increased vulnerability to targeted attacks if compromised.
    - Higher risk of accidental, irreversible system modifications.
    - Difficulty tracking actions performed by the root user.
    
- **sudo as a Secure Alternative:** The `sudo` command grants temporary elevated privileges for specific users, mitigating the risks associated with root access.
    
    - Requires user authentication (your current password) for authorization.
    - Limited to specific commands, not granting full root access.
    

**Granting sudo Access:**

- Not all users can leverage `sudo`. System administrators define authorized users within a configuration file called `sudoers`.

### Authentication and Authorization with sudo Commands

- **useradd:** Adds a new user to the system.
    
    - `sudo useradd username`: Creates a user with the specified username (e.g., `sudo useradd fgarcia`).
    - Additional options:
        
        - `-g`: Sets the primary group (e.g., `sudo useradd -g security fgarcia`).
        - `-G`: Adds supplemental groups (e.g., `sudo useradd -G finance,admin fgarcia`).
        
    
- **usermod:** Modifies existing user accounts.
    
    - Shares `-g` and `-G` options with `useradd` for changing primary and supplemental groups (e.g., `sudo usermod -g executive fgarcia`).
    - Additional options for modifying user attributes:
        
        - `-d`: Changes the home directory (e.g., `sudo usermod -d /home/garcia_f fgarcia`).
        - `-l`: Changes the login name (e.g., `sudo usermod -l jsmith fgarcia`).
        - `-L`: Locks the account (e.g., `sudo usermod -L fgarcia`).
        
    
- **userdel:** Deletes a user from the system.
    
    - `sudo userdel username`: Deletes the user (e.g., `sudo userdel fgarcia`).
    - `-r`: Deletes the user's home directory contents along with the user account (e.g., `sudo userdel -r fgarcia`).
    - **Caution:** Consider deactivating accounts with `usermod -L` instead of immediate deletion, especially for preserving user-owned files.
    
- **chown:** Changes ownership of a file or directory.
    
    - `sudo chown owner:group filename`: Modifies ownership (e.g., `sudo chown fgarcia:security access.txt`).
        
        - `owner`: The new user owner (e.g., `fgarcia`).
        - `:group` (colon required): The new group owner (e.g., `security`).
        - `filename`: The file or directory affected.
        
    

**Important Reminders:**

- Be cautious when copying commands online, especially those involving `sudo`.
- Use `sudo` judiciously, only for commands requiring elevated privileges.
- Consider deactivating accounts instead of immediate deletion for potential file recovery needs.

### Key Takeaways
